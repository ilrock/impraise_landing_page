# Impraise client

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

In order go get the project to work you'll need to have an environment variable (feel free to create a .env file) called PERSONAL_TOKEN and its value should be your personal github token.
